# Project Development Checklist

This checklist tracks the setup and structural development for the Tower Jump and Transit Detection project. The core analysis methodology will be added after further research.

### Phase 1: Project Scaffolding & Setup

This phase establishes a clean, organized, and ready-to-use repository structure.

-   [x] **Task 1: Initialize Repository Structure**
    -   [x] Create the main project directory.
    -   [x] Initialize a Git repository (`git init`).
    -   [x] Add core documentation: `agent.md`, `project_overview.md`, `README.md`.
    -   [x] Create a standard Python `.gitignore` file.
    -   [x] Create the initial directory structure:
        -   `src/` (for all source code)
        -   `src/data_processing/`
        -   `src/analysis/`
        -   `tests/` (for all unit tests)
        -   `data/` (for sample data)
        -   `notebooks/` (for exploratory data analysis)

-   [x] **Task 2: Set Up Environment**
    -   [x] Create a `requirements.txt` file.
    -   [x] Add initial dependencies to `requirements.txt`: `pandas`, `geopandas`, `haversine`, `scikit-learn`, `pytest`, `flake8`.

-   [ ] **Task 3: Implement Data Loading & Standardization**
    -   [x] Create `src/data_models.py`.
    -   [ ] Implement a function `load_and_standardize_data(file_path: str) -> gpd.GeoDataFrame` that reads raw data, standardizes columns, handles data types, and returns a GeoDataFrame.

### Phase 2: Algorithm Implementation (Pending Research)

This phase will contain the core logic once the detection methodologies are finalized.

-   [ ] **Task 4: Develop Core Analysis Functions**
    -   [ ] Implement tower jump detection functions within `src/analysis/`.
    -   [ ] Implement transit and stay-point detection functions within `src/analysis/`.

---

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing

This phase focuses on creating the main application pipeline and ensuring its reliability.

-   [x] **Task 5: Create Main Processing Pipeline**
    -   [x] Create a `main.py` script to orchestrate the full workflow: loading data, calling the analysis functions, and saving the results.

-   [ ] **Task 6: Implement Unit & Integration Tests**
    -   [ ] Develop a comprehensive test suite in the `tests/` directory.
    -   [ ] Write unit tests for data processing functions.
    -   [ ] Write integration tests to validate the end-to-end pipeline once algorithms are in place.
