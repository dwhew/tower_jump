# Project Development Checklist

This checklist tracks the development of the Tower Jump and Transit Detection project, following the methodology outlined in `methods_analysis.md`.

### Phase 1: Project Scaffolding & Setup

This phase establishes a clean, organized, and ready-to-use repository structure.

-   [x] **Task 1: Initialize Repository Structure**
    -   [x] Create the main project directory.
    -   [x] Initialize a Git repository (`git init`).
    -   [x] Add core documentation: `agent.md`, `project_overview.md`, `README.md`.
    -   [x] Create a standard Python `.gitignore` file.
    -   [x] Create the initial directory structure:
        -   `src/` (for all source code)
        -   `src/data_processing/`
        -   `src/analysis/`
        -   `tests/` (for all unit tests)
        -   `data/` (for sample data)
        -   `notebooks/` (for exploratory data analysis)

-   [x] **Task 2: Set Up Environment**
    -   [x] Create a `requirements.txt` file.
    -   [x] Add initial dependencies to `requirements.txt`: `pandas`, `geopandas`, `haversine`, `scikit-learn`, `pytest`, `flake8`, `ptrail`.

-   [ ] **Task 3: Implement Data Preprocessing Pipeline**
    -   [x] Create `src/data_models.py`.
    -   [x] Implement `load_and_standardize_data` function using `ptrail`.
    -   [x] Add initial noise filtering to the pipeline.
    -   [ ] Implement trajectory segmentation.
    -   [ ] Implement feature engineering (distance, speed, etc.).
    -   [ ] Implement data harmonization.

### Phase 2: Probabilistic Algorithm Implementation

This phase will contain the core logic for the detection methodologies.

-   [ ] **Task 4: Implement Core Analysis Functions**
    -   [ ] Implement probabilistic modeling of location points (2D Gaussian distributions).
    -   [ ] Implement uncertainty-aware velocity calculation using Monte Carlo simulation.
    -   [ ] Implement the "Impossible Travel" paradigm for tower jump detection.
    -   [ ] Implement the probabilistic DBSCAN (FDBSCAN) for stay point detection.
    -   [ ] Implement the delineation of transit corridors.

---

### Phase 3: Integration, Confidence Scoring, and Testing

This phase focuses on creating the main application pipeline, developing confidence models, and ensuring reliability.

-   [x] **Task 5: Create Main Processing Pipeline**
    -   [x] Create a `main.py` script to orchestrate the full workflow.

-   [ ] **Task 6: Develop Confidence Score Models**
    -   [ ] Implement the multi-factor confidence score for tower jumps.
    -   [ ] Implement the confidence score for stay points.
    -   [ ] Implement the confidence score for transit corridors.

-   [ ] **Task 7: Implement Unit & Integration Tests**
    -   [ ] Develop a comprehensive test suite in the `tests/` directory.
    -   [ ] Write unit tests for data processing functions.
    -   [ ] Write unit tests for the core analysis functions.
    -   [ ] Write integration tests to validate the end-to-end pipeline.

-   [ ] **Task 8: Validation and Benchmarking**
    -   [ ] Create a ground truth dataset.
    -   [ ] Define and implement performance metrics (F1-score, Jaccard Index).
    -   [ ] Perform parameter tuning and validation.
