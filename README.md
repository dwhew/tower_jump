This project provides a Python-based engine for analyzing raw location data to identify and label common patterns and anomalies. The primary goal is to clean and enrich location histories by detecting "tower jumps" (data noise) and "transit" periods (travel between significant locations).

---

## Key Features

-   **Data Standardization**: Ingests raw location CSV files and transforms them into a clean, standardized GeoDataFrame.
-   **Tower Jump Detection**: Implements algorithms to identify and flag anomalous location points caused by cell tower triangulation errors.
-   **Transit & Stay-Point Detection**: Analyzes user trajectories to distinguish between periods of travel (transit) and periods of rest (stay-points).

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.9 or higher
-   `pip` and `venv`

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To process a data file, run the main script from the root of the project directory. You'll need to provide paths for the input and output files.

```sh
python main.py --input data/raw_user_data.csv --output data/processed_user_data.csv
--input: Path to the raw location data CSV file.

--output: Path where the processed CSV file with labeled data will be saved.

Running Tests
To ensure the reliability and correctness of the code, a test suite is included. Run the tests using pytest:

Bash
